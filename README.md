aquariumController
==================

Combining an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to build an intelligent, controllable, and monitorable aquarium controller. 
The controller can be accessed through a web browser.

Documentation is largely within the code files at present. This will improve before the project is intended for 
public consumption.
